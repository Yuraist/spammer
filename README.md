# spammer
Simple Python script for email spamming. Please use it for learning, not for real spamming. 

To use the script change some lines in spam.py file (change the subject of message, sender, html code, smtp settings if needed, sender's email and password), and some lines in sender.py file (path of email base file). 

Upload the script (spam.py and sender.py files), add .txt file with email of your recipients into current directory and run the script using 'python3 sender.py' command in Terminal.
